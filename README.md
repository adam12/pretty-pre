# Pretty Pre

Preserve indentation in HTML `<pre><code>` blocks.

### Why

It's annoying, specifically when using a code highlighting tool, to have to
left-align the content of a `<pre><code>`. I like to have my entire document
properly indented.

### How

Pretty Pre will strip the leader `|` and preceeding whitespace for each line in
your code block.

### Install

	$ component install adam12/pretty-pre

### Usage

See `example.html`
